# Fake News Classifier Using LSTM

This repository contains code for a Fake News Classifier implemented using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) in Python. The model aims to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content.

## Overview

The Fake News Classifier leverages LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network known for its ability to handle sequential data, to analyze textual information and make predictions about the authenticity of news articles. The code provided here includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction functionalities.

## Files Included

- `Fake News Classifier Using LSTM.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the LSTM model implementation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and NumPy.
3. Open the `Fake News Classifier Using LSTM.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells sequentially.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook guides users through the process of:
- Preprocessing the dataset.
- Building an LSTM model for fake news classification.
- Training the model on the provided dataset.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Making predictions on new data.
